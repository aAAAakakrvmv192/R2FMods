# Character Voice Mod for Right 2 Fight

A purely visual Right 2 Fight mod which allows you to play the voicelines of 4 different characters when doing certain actions.

  ## Features
* Switch between Kiryu, Akiyama, Majima and Vulcan's voicelines.
* Play voicelines during attacks, evading an attack, heat actions, getting hurt, and more.
* 99.9% clientsided (Your taunt sounds won't be heard by others.)

 ## Questions
  
  ### Why switch from pastebin to github?
As a result of obfuscating my code, the script has gotten much more longer. To not clog script executors (and since github looks nice), the script was turned into a loadstring.
  
  ### Obfuscating?
The process of making code look unreadable to humans, but able to be processed by computers. This is to prevent anyone from claiming my code as theirs, and to make it harder to edit.

  ### I found a bug/I have a suggestion!

# Character Morph Mod

Ever wanted to look like the Legendary Dragon himself, or any other enemy? With this mod, you can!

  ## Features
 * Morph yourself into any normal sized enemy (apart from hidden characters like Akiyama, Majima and Guru)
 * Partly clientsided
 
 ## Questions
 
 ### Can I morph to Spoiled Brat, Derek, Shucky, etc..?
Currently, no. I need to edit the code to make it check if you're going to morph into one of those, and scale your character accordingly. Technically you COULD morph yourself into them, but it'll look stupid.
