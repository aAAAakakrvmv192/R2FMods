# Character Voice Mod for Right 2 Fight by Mark#9919

A purely visual Right 2 Fight mod which allows you to play the voicelines of 4 different characters when doing certain actions.

  ## Features
* Switch between Kiryu, Akiyama, Majima and Vulcan's voicelines.
* Play voicelines during attacks, evading an attack, heat actions, getting hurt, and more.
* 99.9% clientsided (Your taunt sounds won't be heard by others.)

 ## Questions
  
  ### Why switch from pastebin to github?
As a result of obfuscating my code, the script has gotten much more longer. To not clog script executors (and since github looks nice), the script was turned into a loadstring.
  
  ### Obfuscating?
The process of making code look unreadable to humans, but able to be processed by computers. This is to prevent anyone from claiming my code as theirs, and to make it harder to edit.

  ### I found a bug/I have a suggestion!
DM Mark#9919.
